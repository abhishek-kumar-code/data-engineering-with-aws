### [Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow](./automate-data-pipelines-with-airflow)
* [Project 4 - Data Pipelines with Airflow]

Objective: 
The objective of this project is to design and implement high grade automated and monitored for Sparkify, a music streaming company, using Apache Airflow to enhance its data warehouse ETL processes. The main goals and requirements for the project are as follows:

* **Automation and Monitoring:**
- Implement automation in the ETL pipelines to streamline and enhance the data processing workflow.
- Ensure robust monitoring mechanisms to track the performance and health of the data pipelines.
- Dynamic and Reusable Data Pipelines:

Design data pipelines that are dynamic, built from reusable tasks, and can be easily modified or extended as needed.
Incorporate functionality for easy backfills to accommodate historical data processing.
Data Quality Assurance:

Implement tests to validate data quality after the ETL steps have been executed.
Ensure that any discrepancies in the datasets are detected and addressed before analyses are run on the data warehouse.
Data Integration:

The source data, residing in Amazon S3, consists of JSON logs detailing user activity and JSON metadata about songs.
Process and load the data into Sparkify's data warehouse on Amazon Redshift, ensuring compatibility and efficient data flow.
