# [Project 2: STEDI Human Balance Analytics](./automate-data-pipelines-with-airflow)

## Objective

This project involves building a **cloud-based data lakehouse solution** for sensor data collected by the STEDI Step Trainer and its mobile app to train a **machine learning model**. The solution will use: 
- **PySpark**: For processing large datasets.
- **AWS Glue**: Managed ETL for data preparation.
- **AWS Athena**: Serverless querying of data.
- **AWS S3**: Scalable storage for raw and processed data.
As a Data Engineer, you will extract and curate data from the **Step Trainer sensors** and the **mobile app** into the data lakehouse on AWS, enabling Data Scientists to train the model.

### STEDI Step Trainer Overview

The STEDI Step Trainer is a device designed to help users with balance exercises. It has the following features:

- **Sensors** detect motion and distance.
- The **mobile app** collects customer data and accelerometer data (X, Y, Z directions) for motion tracking.
- **Data Privacy Considerations**: Only data from **consenting customers** will be used for the machine learning model, ensuring privacy is prioritized.

## Lakehouse Architecture

The **Medallion Architecture** is a key feature of a **lakehouse architecture** that allows for the efficient ingestion and incremental improvement of data. This architecture organizes data into stages, each representing a different level of refinement. Each stage is symbolized by a color, similar to the medals in the Olympics.

![Image Alt Text](spark-and-data-lakes/images/lakehouse_architecture.png)

### Stages of Data Refinement

1. **Bronze (Raw Data)**: This is the initial stage where raw, unprocessed data is ingested into the lakehouse.
     - Data may contain errors, duplicates, or inconsistencies.
     - Minimal processing or transformation has been applied.
 
2. **Silver (Cleaned and Augmented Data)**: At this stage, the data undergoes filtering, cleaning, and augmentation to improve quality.
     - Errors and duplicates are removed.
     - Data is transformed to ensure consistency and standardization.

3. **Gold (Business-Level Aggregates)**: The final stage where data is aggregated to a business level, often using structures like **star schemas** for easy reporting and analytics.
     - Includes business-level aggregates, metrics, and KPIs.
     - Ready for consumption by business analysts or reporting tools.

## Datasets

STEDI provides three JSON data sources for use with the **Step Trainer**. These datasets are available in the following folders in the GitHub repository:

- **customer**
- **step_trainer**
- **accelerometer**

### 1. Customer Records: 
This dataset contains information from **fulfillment** and the **STEDI website**.
  - **AWS S3 Bucket URI**: `s3://cd0030bucket/customers/`

### 2. Step Trainer Records
This dataset includes data from the **motion sensor** on the Step Trainer device.
- **AWS S3 Bucket URI**: `s3://cd0030bucket/step_trainer/`

### 3. Accelerometer Records
This dataset contains data from the **mobile appâs accelerometer**.
- **AWS S3 Bucket URI**: `s3://cd0030bucket/accelerometer/`

## S3 Bucket Structure
On completion of this project, the S3 bucket should have the following directory structure:
```bash
customer/
- landing/
- trusted/
- curated/
accelerometer/
- landing/
- trusted/
step_trainer/
- landing/
- trusted/
- curated/
```

## Project Details

This project involves creating and managing **AWS Glue** tables for different datasets and performing data sanitization, validation, and aggregation tasks to support data analysis and machine learning model training.

#### High-Level Architecture

![Image Alt Text](spark-and-data-lakes/images/workflow_flowchart.png)

![Image Alt Text](spark-and-data-lakes/images/relationship_entities.png)

#### Stage 1: Create Glue Tables for Landing Zones

To get a feel for the data, you will create three Glue tables for the three landing zones. Query the tables using AWS Athena.

- `customer_landing.sql`
- `accelerometer_landing.sql`
- `step_trainer_landing.sql`

#### Stage 2: Create Spark Jobs for Sanitizing Customer and Accelerometer Data

The **Data Science team** has identified that the **Accelerometer Records** match **Customer Records**. You need to create two AWS Glue jobs to sanitize the data:

- **Job 1**: Sanitize **Customer Data** (from Website, Landing Zone).
  - Store **only customer records** that agreed to share their data for research purposes in a new Glue Table called `customer_trusted`.

- **Job 2**: Sanitize **Accelerometer Data** (from Mobile App, Landing Zone).
  - Store **only accelerometer readings** from customers who agreed to share their data for research purposes in a new Glue Table called `accelerometer_trusted`.

#### Stage 3: Create Spark Jobs to handle Data Quality Issue with Serial Numbers

A data quality issue exists where **Customer Records** in the **Landing Zone** contain duplicate serial numbers for many customers. However, **Step Trainer Records** contain the correct serial numbers.

- **Job 3**: Create a Spark job that sanitizes **Customer Data** (from Trusted Zone) and:
  - **Matches** customers with corresponding **Accelerometer Data**.
  - Creates a new Glue Table called `customers_curated`, containing **only customers who have accelerometer data** and agreed to share their data.

#### Stage 4: Create Spark Jobs to support further data processing

- **Job 4**: Step Trainer Trusted Data
  - Read the **Step Trainer IoT data stream** (S3) and populate a **Trusted Zone Glue Table** called `step_trainer_trusted`:
  - Only include data for customers who have **accelerometer data** and agreed to share their data for research purposes (from `customers_curated`).

- **Job 5**: Machine Learning Curated Data
  - Create an aggregated table that combines **Step Trainer Readings** and the corresponding **Accelerometer Readings**:
  - Match data based on the **same timestamp**.
  - Store this aggregated data in a Glue Table called `machine_learning_curated`:
    - Include only data from customers who agreed to share their data for research purposes.


## Data Validation

As part of the project, it is essential to validate the data at each stage to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the processed datasets. After completing each stage of the project, check the row count in the produced tables to confirm that they match the expected values.

### Expected Row Counts

#### 1. **Landing Zone**
   - **Customer**: 956 rows
   - **Accelerometer**: 81,273 rows
   - **Step Trainer**: 28,680 rows

#### 2. **Trusted Zone**
   - **Customer**: 482 rows
   - **Accelerometer**: 40,981 rows
   - **Step Trainer**: 14,460 rows

#### 3. **Curated Zone**
   - **Customer**: 482 rows
   - **Machine Learning**: 43,681 rows
